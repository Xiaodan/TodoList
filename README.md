This is the README file for CS498 MP1 Spring 2013.  

1) Additional Features that you attempted.  
No, I just tried sorting methods (alphabetically & by deadlines) and some animations.  

2) Code Quality items that you attempted (and needed information like .. which style guide you used).  
I used JQuery Core, Google style guides. And I use this gitHub repo to do version control.  

3) Anything extra that you did and you think should be looked at.  
I drew the background picture myself online.  
And it seems that all the colors I used were regarded as the most pleasant colors for people.  

4) Sources - A list of any sources that you used code or design from and what license that work is under.  
jquery-1.8.2.min.js, jQplugIns.js, jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.js, date.js, 960 gird system.
